# Image-Classification-Model-Using-Visual-Bag-of-Semantic-Words

# Abstract
A graph cut based automatic segmentation algorithm is used to identify the segmented parts of an image by using SVM predictive models. Visual Bag of Words (BoW) is a widely used in image classifcation problem. However, due to its lower accuracy for semantic extraction and huge computational cost arises from large size of vocabulary lead us to and a new way to solve the image classification problem. Visual Bag of Semantic Words (BoSW) is our proposed model that will address those issues properly. The proposed model includes an automatic segmentation algorithm based on graph cuts to extract major semantic regions. A supervised learning approach for 4-class classifcation problem will be applied to label the segmented regions of target classes. Apart from SVM, other classifers: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RDF), Naive Byes (NB) and Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms also will be used to fit the relationship and be compared their performance.

This project is re-implementation of the articles [1].
